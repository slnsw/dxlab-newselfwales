Newtown. Courtney is a music photographer. He covers lots of live music and has been doing it for a few years. We get to chatting and reflect on the changes in the world, specifically Sydney in the last few years. The changes are profound and remarkable we agree. The battles \/ definitions \/ constraints of gender, orientation, preference and manifestations of these have been settled. Certainly in the inner city world of music and culture that we both inhabit. And of course these changes have flowed outward into mainstream culture. The next big issue that we will be working through is how we live with the realities of our countries contemporary history of genocide, occupation and colonialism. The systemic advantages of being born into power, (often described in terms of the colour of your skin) and how we and the institutions we work within can become part of a meaningful rebalancing. #fbiradio #dispossessed #genderbalance #colonialism #massacres #frontierwars @manningbar #fbiturns15 @musicology.xyz #newselfwales","imageType":"instagram_selfie","date":"2018-11-07 08:58:54","dateText":"","timestamp":1541454577,"instagramUsername":"hamish.tame","featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1541468410183-.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1541468410183--300x300.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"__typename":"MediaSize"},"full":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1541468410183-.jpg","width":1080,"height":1080,"__typename":"MediaSize"},"__typename":"MediaSizes"},"__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"NewSelfWalesInstagramSelfie"}}
