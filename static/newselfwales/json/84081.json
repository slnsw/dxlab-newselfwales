We all have an instant connection and understanding of what each other has been through and had to deal with throughout the year.\nMilitary life is definitely not for everyone and sometimes it's hard to know if it's for us, but I love seeing the bonds and friendships that are made. They are built on sometimes, a life and death situational trust and that to me is a life long friendships.\n\nThank you to all who have served and those currently serving to defend our country.\n\n#SamiSparrow #art #creativecolourcollective","imageType":"instagram_selfie","date":"2018-11-05 09:25:43","dateText":"","timestamp":1541197466,"instagramUsername":"samisparrow020","featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1541197804703-.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1541197804703--300x300.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"__typename":"MediaSize"},"full":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1541197804703-.jpg","width":955,"height":955,"__typename":"MediaSize"},"__typename":"MediaSizes"},"__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"NewSelfWalesInstagramSelfie"}}
