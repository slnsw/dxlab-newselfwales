Mum of three beautiful souls. I have been a photographer since age 16 when I used to borrow a cool Pentax old fashion camera that my Dad had from Japan. Since then my passion evolved at a point that made me leave my 17 years in the advertising field to dedicate myself to what I love doing. That\u2019s my story. I hope someday I can register your lifestyle to record your beautiful memories. Register people's lifestyle stories is a passion \nI inspire myself by the art of capturing the beauty of nature.\nWhere there is no posing, lighting effects, manipulation or any control over the natural environment.","imageType":"instagram_selfie","date":"2018-10-02 11:14:20","dateText":"","timestamp":1536575126,"instagramUsername":"liamarxx","featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1538406681617-.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1538406681617--300x300.jpg","width":300,"height":300,"__typename":"MediaSize"},"full":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1538406681617-.jpg","width":1080,"height":1078,"__typename":"MediaSize"},"__typename":"MediaSizes"},"__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"NewSelfWalesInstagramSelfie"}}
