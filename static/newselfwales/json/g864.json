I had a planned iron infusion booked for Wednesday but when I woke up yesterday my body said NUH UH so I headed into the emergency room with my iron infusion script and had it done straight away. Some have been asking about what was going on - basically because of my Von Willebrand Disease (a bleeding disorder), I lose iron heaps quicker than normal during my period. (Do I need to elaborate? Lol). I had an iron infusion last year, I was told I need one yearly but obviously with my symptoms I should have had it sooner. (I also need to look into treating my bleeding disorder better!). I saw my GP on Thursday and had a blood test to check my iron levels. Results came back the next day with my ferritin at 6 (should be 15-200). My symptoms have been - extreme tiredness, napping HARD every day for months, headaches every day, vertigo, head to toe muscle aches (feels like a struggle, concrete like heaviness), shortness of breath, heart palpitations. Yes, I have tried all kinds of iron supplements and nutrition over the last 20 years but I don\u2019t seem to absorb enough to maintain good levels. SO ANYWAY, spent yesterday having my infusion and should start to feel better next week or so. Still feeling like a zombie but I\u2019m so grateful to have been able to go in and get some help straight away. I need to learn to trust my instincts and take better care of myself, I bet some of you do too. \ud83d\udc9c Please go get yourself checked out if you\u2019ve been feeling crappy like this - it\u2019s
