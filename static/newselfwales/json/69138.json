I can never express how I always felt I'm born in the wrong era- that I do things the old-fashioned way, I write on my typewriter, I hold values of the past.\n.\n.\nMy all time fave film Midnight in Paris (swipe) whisked me off on a time travel to the 1920s era. This film, it opens up a visual feast- so picturesque, imaginative, charming. Something realists would tell you to snap out of. But I just like to see the world like that, through those dreamy lens- dancing in the streets of Paris in the rain, live music in a pub, living as a broke artist but it's alright cos you have the antidote to the emptiness of existence. This film is literally how I see life. If you want to see life through my eyes watch this film.\n.\n.\n.\n#midnightinparis #throwback #1920s #filmreview #portraits #paris #timetravel #ootd #styleinspo #style #vintageclothing #vintage #oldsoul #soulful_moments #prettylittleiiinspo #newselfwales","imageType":"instagram_selfie","date":"2018-09-07 12:15:42","dateText":"","timestamp":1536193935,"instagramUsername":"graysfoo","featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1536281417022-.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1536281417022--300x238.jpg","width":300,"height":238,"__typename":"MediaSize"},"full":{"sourceUrl":"https:\/\/dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au\/images-newselfwales\/selfie-1536281417022-.jpg","width":1080,"height":855,"__typename":"MediaSize"},"__typename":"MediaSizes"},"__typename":"Media"},"__typename":"NewSelfWalesInstagramSelfie"}}
